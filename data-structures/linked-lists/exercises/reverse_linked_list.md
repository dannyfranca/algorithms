## Check before

- Is the Linked list a cycle? Test this by using the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm. We use two pointers, a slow and a fast one. One pointer moves twice and fast them the first one and we check if at any point they will point to the same node.

## For each element

- If first, next pointer in none
- Else, get the previous element and add to next pointer
